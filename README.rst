--------------------------------------------------

This repository is based on `phusion/baseimage-docker <https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker>`_ and uses ubuntu 14.04 to build a docker friendly baseimage similar to its original predecessor.

This Dockerfile is still under development so consider it as beta similar to Ubuntu LTS 14.04
